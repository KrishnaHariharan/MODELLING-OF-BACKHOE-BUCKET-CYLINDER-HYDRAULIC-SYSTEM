# MODELLING-OF-BACKHOE-BUCKET-CYLINDER-HYDRAULIC-SYSTEM
Modelling of a system is a vital tool for cost reduction, saving wastage and for catalysing the design process. This project aims to model and simulate a hydraulically actuated backhoe of an excavator used in construction, transporting of building materials, digging and excavation of land surfaces. Hydraulics is generally preferred over other means of actuation because of the ability to handle large forces, good control of speed and motion and self-lubricating property of oils.

A backhoe model typically consists of a pump, pressure relief valve, directional control valve and actuating cylinder. Modelling of backhoe combines the designing of mechanical and hydraulic sub systems in MATLAB Simulink environment. Sim mechanics is used for mechanical part modelling and Sim hydraulics is used for hydraulic circuit design.

A 3D model of a backhoe actuation system is then modelled using Simscape Multibody. The interaction between the components of the system and their performances are analysed. Observing and understanding the behaviour of each component in dynamic working conditions with respect to time are studied. This project presents the simulation results of the dynamic working of a backhoe model which can be used to analyse and optimise the performance of the actuation system.
